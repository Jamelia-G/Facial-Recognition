# Facial-Recognition

**Objective:** To recognize identities given an image

**Description:** 
This project leverages facial embeddings, the VGG Face Model, and CNNs to accurately identify facial embeddings and predict identities from a pool of 105 identities. The resulting "SoftMax classifier Model" was trained on the Pins Face Recognition Dataset from Kaggle, which comprised 17,534 faces across 105 identities. The VGG Face model was first used to extract facial embeddings, which were then passed through a neural network outfitted with ReLu activation, Batch Normalization, and regularization techniques. 

**Skills:** Creating Metadata, Image Augmentation, Data Preprocessing, CNN model, hyperparameter tuning, Model Evaluation

**Technology:** PyTorch, Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Sckit-Learn), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Google Cloud Platform(GCP)
